Description: Debian Package Builder
 Debreate is a utility to aid in creating installable Debian packages (.deb).
 .
 The goal behind the project is to make developing for Debian based Linux
 distributions more appealing, with an easy to use interface for packaging
 applications, artwork, media, themes, etc.
 .
 Currently, it only supports "binary" packaging which allows packaging of
 anything that does not require being compiled from source, such as scripted
 applications or media. These packages can then be used for personal
 distribution.
 .
 Plans for using backends such as dh_make & debuild for creating source packages
 are in the works. But source packaging can be quite different & is a must if
 you want to get your packages into a distribution's official repositories or a
 Launchpad Personal Package Archive (PPA).
